# Codementor Link Shortener Challenge

Building a Link Shortener using Bitly API

## Requirements

The user will input a valid URL and click a "shorten" button. The shortened URL will then be displayed.

Your UI should include the following elements:

Text input for the user's URL
"Shorten" button to trigger the link shortening
Display area to return the shortened URL to the user

### For extra challenge:

Make it easier for the user to copy the shortened URL by adding a "copy" button for one-click copying.
Try to allow the user to automatically copy the shortened URL by using libraries like SimpleCopy or ClipboardJS.

## Suggested Implementation

This project can be implemented as a webpage using any front end stack (e.g. JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue.js).
You can use free link shortenings services such as bit.ly to process the URL.
